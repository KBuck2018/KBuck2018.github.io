    "For this project, I was tasked with developing a web application using HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript. To do this effectively, I built out the entire application by using div elements and buttons in html/css and then creating a function for each. Naturally, this is as ineffective as you can get, so once I had built out my rudimentary layout, I refactored everything by automating my button creation, using key identifiers. This allowed me to effectively pin point each button and cut my code from 400 lines to 100. I plan on giving this application some new features soon including video content, sounds, a countdown, and multiplayer.";
